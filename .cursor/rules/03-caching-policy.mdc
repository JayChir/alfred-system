alwaysApply: true

- Target ~90% hit on repeat Notion reads; sub-second on cache hits.
- Read-through; write-path invalidation on mutations; configurable TTL map; `forceRefresh=true` escape hatch.
- PG schema records `hit_count`, `expires_at`, `content_hash` for change detection & metrics.
- Batch Notion writes via "smart staging" to cut API calls ~70%.
