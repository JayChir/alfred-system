# Mission
Cloud-native MCP assistant that cuts token cost ~80%, responds <3s P95, and works everywhere (desktop, web, mobile).

# Primary Goals & Targets
- Token efficiency: <100k tokens/session (≈80% reduction).
- Latency: <3s P95; sub-second on cached reads; ~90% cache hit for Notion content.
- Cost: total <$40–100/mo; per-session <$2. Favor performance first, optimize later.
- Reliability: 99.5% uptime; zero context loss incidents.

# Non-goals (MVP)
No native mobile app; single-user initially; manual model switching; PG only (no Neo4j).

# User/UX Priorities
Mobile capture (95% success), ADHD-friendly escalation, cross-device continuity.
